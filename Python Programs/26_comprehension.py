# List comprehension :
#     --> List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

# Generator comprehension :
#     --> Set comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
#     --> Generator Comprehensions are very similar to list comprehensions.
#     --> One difference between them is that generator comprehensions use circular brackets whereas list comprehensions use square brackets.
#     --> generators donâ€™t allocate memory for the whole list. Instead, they generate each value one by one which is why they are memory efficient.
#     --> newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
